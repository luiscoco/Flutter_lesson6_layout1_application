# Flutter: some patterns samples



## 1. Simple App (No Architecture)

Learning Flutter involves understanding not only the UI framework but also the architectural patterns that can help manage your app's complexity as it grows

Here are some common architectural templates you can consider when starting with Flutter:

For very simple applications, you might start with no specific architecture, just a single main file (main.dart).

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Simple App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, world!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
